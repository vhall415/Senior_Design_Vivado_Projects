2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net camera_receiver_0/inst/_inferred__0/i__n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin camera_receiver_0/inst/_inferred__0/i_/O, cell camera_receiver_0/inst/_inferred__0/i_. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net camera_receiver_0/inst/byte_num_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin camera_receiver_0/inst/byte_num_reg_i_2/O, cell camera_receiver_0/inst/byte_num_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net camera_receiver_0/inst/pixel_data_out_reg[15]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin camera_receiver_0/inst/pixel_data_out_reg[15]_i_1/O, cell camera_receiver_0/inst/pixel_data_out_reg[15]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net camera_receiver_0/inst/state_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin camera_receiver_0/inst/state_reg_i_2/O, cell camera_receiver_0/inst/state_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net camera_receiver_0/inst/write_en_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin camera_receiver_0/inst/write_en_reg_i_1/O, cell camera_receiver_0/inst/write_en_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port sda_0 expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
