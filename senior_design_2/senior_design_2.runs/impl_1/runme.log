WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net bram1/pRead_counter/full_reg is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin bram1/pRead_counter/status_reg_i_1/O, cell bram1/pRead_counter/status_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 bram1/memory_reg has an input control pin bram1/memory_reg/ENARDEN (net: bram1/memory_reg_ENARDEN_cooolgate_en_sig_47) which is driven by a register (bram1/full_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
