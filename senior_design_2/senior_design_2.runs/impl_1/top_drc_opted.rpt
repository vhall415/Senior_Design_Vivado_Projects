2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 bram1/memory_reg has an input control pin bram1/memory_reg/ENARDEN (net: bram1/memory_reg_ENARDEN_cooolgate_en_sig_1) which is driven by a register (bram1/full_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#2 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 bram1/memory_reg has an input control pin bram1/memory_reg/ENBWREN (net: bram1/outputData0) which is driven by a register (bram1/empty_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#3 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 bram1/memory_reg has an input control pin bram1/memory_reg/WEA[0] (net: bram1/memory_reg_i_2_n_0) which is driven by a register (bram1/full_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#4 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 bram1/memory_reg has an input control pin bram1/memory_reg/WEA[1] (net: bram1/memory_reg_i_2_n_0) which is driven by a register (bram1/full_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port sda expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
